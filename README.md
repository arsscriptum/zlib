Coding Standards
-----------------
In terms of code standards, I mainly use the Google style guides (C++, JavaScript, Objective-C, and Python) for my personal projets so this is the coding style I adopted for this project.
Consistency is most important to strive for, the header of the provided library is formated differently from the rest of the projet, but that's about it.
